## UML

Attached to this project are three UML diagrams : 
1. You can find [here](https://github.com//Metreeler/car_racing/blob/main/deliverables/Activity_Diagram.png) the activity diagram of this application. We have two types of user with different interactions to this game
2. You can find [here](https://github.com//Metreeler/car_racing/blob/main/deliverables/Use_case_diagram.png) the use case diagram of this application with all the different action path for the two types of user

## Metrics

In order to get some metrics for this project I used SonarCloud which is an online version on SonarQube. SonarQube is a tool to get the metrics of a project such as number of bugs, technical debt, lines of code, etc. SonarCloud allows me to get different metrics and to display the up-to-date version of these metrics thanks to badges.

- lines of code : [![Lines of Code](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Metreeler_car_racing&metric=ncloc)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Metreeler_car_racing)

## Clean Code Development

## Build Management

I am using PyBuilder to build this project 

## Unit Tests

## Continuous Delivery

The continuous delivery of my project is handled by Travis CI. 
This software allows me to build the project each time I push a new commit, using the combination of PyBuilder and Travis CI.

The status of the build is available here :

## IDE

For this project and most of my project in Python I use PyCharm. This IDE is made specifically for Python project and is easy to handle. Almost every feature is intuitive and thanks to the different sub-windows, it is easy to navigate between the code, the directories, the run windows, etc.

This IDE also analyze the code in real time to tell whether there are errors or warning in the code, so you don't have to run it and patch all the errors one by one.

Pycharm also have an integrated Git interface, which is really intuitive. However, out of habit I still use command lines and a command window.
